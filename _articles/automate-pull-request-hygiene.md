# PRs that fill in their own paperwork (and a gate that won't let bad code merge)

*Subtitle: Half of code review is chores — linking the ticket, assigning yourself, checking the analyzer. So I automated the chores and kept humans for the judgment.*

Open a pull request on most teams and you're greeted by a checklist: link the Jira ticket, assign yourself, confirm the analyzer passes, tick the boxes. None of it is hard. All of it is friction. And friction at the *start* of review is the worst kind, because it delays the part that actually matters — a human reading your code.

So I split PR review into two buckets. **Chores** (mechanical, rule-based, boring) get automated. **Judgment** (is this the right change?) stays with people. Two workflows handle the chores: one enriches every new PR with context, the other runs a real quality gate and manages its own labels and comments.

## The problem

The opening minutes of every PR were spent on the same low-value motions:

- Copy the ticket ID from the branch name, build the Jira URL, paste it in.
- Assign yourself (or get pinged because you forgot).
- Tick the template checkboxes.
- And on the reviewer's side: pull the branch, run the analyzer, discover the translation file has a trailing-comma syntax error that breaks the build, leave a comment, wait.

Every one of those is deterministic. A human doing them is a human not reading code.

## The idea

Two PR-triggered workflows:

1. **PR automation** — on `opened`, derive context from the branch and write it into the PR: the ticket link, the assignee, a `wip` label.
2. **The analysis gate** — on `opened` and every push, validate translation JSON, run the analyzer, then **label, comment, and block** on failure — and *remove* the label and comment when the next push fixes it.

The theme that makes them feel good to use: **idempotency and self-cleanup.** They never double-post, never leave stale state, and converge to "correct" no matter how many times you push.

## How it works

![Flow: a PR passing a JSON check and the analyzer, then merge-allowed or blocked with a self-deleting comment](/article-images/automate-pull-request-hygiene-diagram.webp)

### Auto-context on open

The ticket ID already lives in the branch name — `feature/PROJ-123-add-audio-seek`. A regex lifts it out, no external lookup needed:

```js
const match = branch.match(/([A-Z]+-\d+)/);
if (match) {
  const jiraId = match[1];                 // PROJ-123
  const url = `https://your-tracker/browse/${jiraId}`;
  // write the link into the PR body, replacing the template placeholder
}
```

The same step ticks the "I added the Jira link" checkbox in the template, assigns the author if the PR has no assignee yet, and adds a `wip` label. Each action guards itself first — *does it already have an assignee? does the label exist?* — so re-runs are no-ops:

```js
// Create the label only if it's missing (404 = doesn't exist yet)
try {
  await github.rest.issues.getLabel({ owner, repo, name: 'wip' });
} catch (e) {
  if (e.status === 404) {
    await github.rest.issues.createLabel({ owner, repo, name: 'wip', color: 'fbca04' });
  }
}
```

That try/get-create-on-404 pattern shows up in every one of these workflows. GitHub has no "ensure label exists" call, so you build it yourself — and once you have it, label management stops being something humans think about.

### A gate that validates more than Dart

The analysis workflow runs on open and on every push, scoped to the files that matter:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    paths: ['**.dart', 'pubspec.yaml', 'assets/translations/**.json']

concurrency:
  group: dart-analysis-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

That `concurrency` block matters more than it looks. Push three times in a minute and you don't want three analyzer runs racing to comment on the same PR — you want the latest one to win and the rest to cancel. `cancel-in-progress: true` gives you exactly that.

First it validates translation files, because a malformed localization JSON breaks the build in a way the Dart analyzer won't catch:

```bash
for f in assets/translations/*.json; do
  python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('$f'))" || { echo "Invalid JSON: $f"; exit 1; }
done
```

Then the analyzer, captured rather than fail-fast so we can format the result ourselves:

```bash
flutter analyze > analysis-output.txt 2>&1 || true
grep "error •" analysis-output.txt && echo "has_errors=true" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
```

### The part I'm proud of: bidirectional state

Most "lint bot" workflows only know how to complain. This one also knows how to *take it back*. On failure, it adds an `analysis-failed` label and posts one comment with the errors tucked inside a collapsible `<details>` block (so the PR stays skimmable). On the next push, if analysis passes, it removes the label and **deletes its own comment**:

```js
// On pass: find the bot's previous failure comment and remove it
const comments = await github.rest.issues.listComments({ owner, repo, issue_number });
const stale = comments.data.find(c =>
  c.user.type === 'Bot' && c.body.includes('Dart Analysis Failed'));
if (stale) await github.rest.issues.deleteComment({ owner, repo, comment_id: stale.id });
```

The `c.user.type === 'Bot'` filter is the safety latch: the workflow only ever deletes comments *it* wrote, never a human's. The result is a PR timeline that reflects the *current* state, not a graveyard of "❌ failed / ✅ fixed / ❌ failed again" noise. When the gate is green, it's silent.

And when it's red, it actually blocks — the job exits non-zero so the merge is gated, not just decorated:

```bash
[ "$has_errors" = "true" ] && exit 1
```

## What it bought us

- **Reviewers start on the code, not the chores.** Context is already there when they open the PR.
- **A whole category of broken builds never reaches `master`** — malformed translations and analyzer errors are caught at the door.
- **The PR timeline stays clean.** Self-deleting comments mean no stale failure noise to scroll past.
- **Around 5 fewer "please link the ticket / please rebase / CI is red because of a comma" round-trips per week.**

## Gotchas & trade-offs

- **Editing the PR body is brittle.** Auto-ticking checkboxes is naive string replacement — if someone reworded the template, the match silently fails. Keep the template text stable, or match loosely.
- **`paths:` is a double-edged filter.** Scope it too tightly and a relevant change skips the gate; too loosely and you run the analyzer on doc-only PRs. Revisit it as the repo grows.
- **Bot-comment deletion depends on the bot identity.** If you switch the token the comments are posted under, the `user.type === 'Bot'` filter can stop matching your own history. Test after any auth change.
- **Automating chores can hide them.** New teammates never learn *why* the ticket link matters because they never do it manually. Worth a sentence in onboarding so the automation is understood, not just trusted.

## Takeaway

Separate the **chores** of review from the **judgment** of review, and automate only the chores — idempotently, with self-cleanup, so the bot's output always reflects current reality. The win isn't "look, a bot." It's that every human minute on a PR now goes to the one thing humans are uniquely good at: deciding whether the change is right.

Next: making two sources of truth — Jira and GitHub — actually agree with each other.

## The complete workflow

Here is the full, genericized workflow — drop it into `.github/workflows/` and replace the placeholders (`your-org`, the `PROJ` project key, `<@DISCORD_USER_ID>`, the example team, and the secret names) with your own.
