# A repo that cleans up after itself — without deleting the wrong branch

*Subtitle: Deleting branches in bulk is a one-keystroke disaster waiting to happen. The fix is to make deletion the last step of a careful classification — and to cap, defer, and audit everything.*

Old branches are the junk drawer of a repo. Every merged feature, every abandoned experiment, every "let me just try something" leaves one behind. They pile up silently — clones get slower, branch pickers get unusable, and `git branch -r` scrolls for a screen and a half. On a long-lived repo with a busy team, you wake up one day with hundreds of dead branches.

The naive fix — a script that deletes anything old — is how you delete a release branch someone needed, or a long-running integration branch that just hadn't been touched in a while. With deletion, "oops" is expensive. You don't get to be cavalier.

So I built branch cleanup as a **classification problem first and a deletion problem second.** The deleting is three lines. The safety is everything before it.

## The problem

Unmanaged branches cause slow, compounding pain:

1. **Clutter that slows people down.** Hundreds of stale refs make branch lists and tooling sluggish and confusing.
2. **No signal about what's safe to remove.** Is this branch merged? Abandoned? An active long-runner that's just quiet this week? You can't tell at a glance, so nobody cleans up at all.
3. **Cleanup is scary, so it never happens.** The risk of nuking something important means the junk drawer just grows forever.

## The idea

A scheduled workflow — Sunday at 4am, when nobody's pushing — that fetches *every* branch and the full PR history, then sorts each branch into a category before a single deletion happens:

- **Sacred** — `master`, `develop`, the default branch. Never touched.
- **Protected** — anything with branch protection on. Never touched.
- **Open-PR** — the head or base of an open PR. Active; leave it.
- **Merged** — already merged via a PR. Safe to delete.
- **Stale** — last commit older than a threshold (default ~2 years). Safe to delete.
- **Active** — recent commits, no reason to remove. Keep.

Only the *Merged* and *Stale* buckets get deleted, and even then, carefully.

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 4 * * 0'      # Sunday 04:00 UTC
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      age_days:      { default: '730' }   # ~2 years
      max_deletions: { default: '50' }    # hard cap per run
```

## How it works

![Classification funnel: branches sorted into sacred, protected, open-PR, merged, stale and active, with a capped delete tray](/article-images/automated-stale-branch-cleanup-diagram.png)

### Build the world before you judge it

You can't classify a branch in isolation — you need to know whether it backs an open PR, whether it was merged, and how old its tip is. So the first step assembles the full picture: all open PRs (to collect their head/base refs), all merged PRs (to know what's been merged and by whom), and every branch with its last-commit timestamp and protection flag.

```bash
# Every branch with sha + protected flag, as TSV
gh api repos/$REPO/branches --paginate \
  | jq -r '.[] | [.name, .commit.sha, (.protected|tostring)] | @tsv'
```

### Classify with a strict precedence

Each branch runs through the categories in priority order — and **safety always wins ties.** Sacred beats protected beats open-PR beats merged beats stale. A branch that is both "merged" and "backs an open PR" is kept, because the open-PR check comes first. The ordering is the safety policy:

```bash
if   in_list "$NAME" "$SACRED";    then echo "SKIP:sacred"
elif [ "$PROTECTED" = "true" ];    then echo "SKIP:protected"
elif in_list "$NAME" "$OPEN_REFS"; then echo "SKIP:open-pr"
elif is_merged "$NAME";            then echo "DELETE:merged"
elif older_than "$CUTOFF" "$NAME"; then echo "DELETE:stale"
else                                    echo "KEEP:active"
fi
```

Stale detection is just epoch math — compare the tip commit's timestamp to a cutoff:

```bash
CUTOFF=$(( $(date -u +%s) - AGE_DAYS * 86400 ))
```

### Cap and defer — never delete unboundedly

Here's the rule that turns a bulk operation from terrifying into routine: **never delete more than N in one run.** If 400 branches qualify, delete the first 50, and *defer the rest to next week*. A capped, repeated cleanup converges safely; an uncapped one is a single command that can wreck a repo. The cap is a circuit breaker against a bad classification — if something's wrong, you've harmed 50 branches, not 800, and you'll see it before the next run.

The deferred branches are logged, not lost — the run reports exactly what it skipped for capacity so there are no surprises.

### Delete carefully, link back, and audit

Even the deletion step is defensive. Branch names contain slashes and the occasional oddity, so they're URL-encoded before the API call. And when a *merged* branch is deleted, the workflow comments on its original PR — closing the loop so there's a trail from "this branch is gone" back to "here's why":

```bash
ENC=$(jq -rn --arg x "$NAME" '$x|@uri')          # handle slashes/special chars
gh api -X DELETE "repos/$REPO/git/refs/heads/$ENC"
# then, for merged branches, comment on the source PR: "branch auto-deleted by cleanup"
```

Every action lands in two places: a digest posted to team chat (counts, grouped by reason, with author attribution) and a full job summary with tables of what was deleted, what was deferred, and what was kept. Bulk deletion without an audit trail is how you lose the ability to answer "what happened to my branch?" — so the trail is non-negotiable.

## What it bought us

- **The junk drawer stays empty** without anyone doing scary manual cleanup.
- **Zero accidents**, because deletion is the last step of a conservative classification, not a blunt age filter.
- **A clear record.** Every deletion is attributable and explained, with merged branches linked back to their PRs.
- **It self-throttles.** A big backlog clears over several capped runs instead of one heart-stopping purge — around 100 dead branches reclaimed.

## Gotchas & trade-offs

- **"Merged" is subtler than it looks.** Squash-merges don't leave the branch as an ancestor of `master`, so ancestry checks lie — rely on the *PR* merge record, not `git branch --merged`.
- **Protection flags are only as good as your config.** The workflow honors branch protection, but if an important long-runner isn't protected and goes quiet past the threshold, it qualifies as stale. Protect what matters, or widen "sacred."
- **API pagination has real limits.** Listing thousands of PRs/branches can truncate; the job logs when a list may be incomplete rather than pretending it saw everything. Trust-but-verify your counts on large repos.
- **The cap is a feature, resist removing it.** "Just clean it all up at once" is the request that precedes the incident. Defer-and-repeat is slower and far safer.
- **Schedule it for quiet hours.** Deleting branches while people push invites races. Off-peak isn't just politeness; it reduces edge cases.

## Takeaway

Any automation that deletes should be a classifier with a delete step bolted on the end — never a delete step with a filter. Order your categories so safety wins every tie, cap the blast radius per run, defer the overflow, and audit every action with a trail back to *why*. Make the destructive thing boring and reversible-in-spirit, and bulk cleanup stops being a thing you're afraid to run.

Next, the finale: aggregating git and Jira into per-person weekly summaries with an LLM — and the hard conversation about doing that responsibly.
